CryptoJunks are generative genitals with 10,000 unique collectible "junks" with proof of ownership storedon the [Ethereum blockchain](#). We have been inspired by all the work Larva Labs has produced and we are huge fans of CryptoPunks. It got us thinking, much like the [Pringles man](#), what do the bodies of the punks look like? After some exploration, <Popup label="CryptoJunks" title="THE FUCKING SITE U R ON.wtf"><Box css={{ height: "$16" }} /></Popup> was born.Currently showing at the Open Chodes Exhibition in Germany and at Queef Denver 2021. The first "Non-Fungenital Tokens," and inspiration for the Ethereum ERC-420 69 standard.Let’s be honest with ourselves, you can’t afford a Punk, so grab some Junk instead.

See the marketplace instructions below to acquire your very own Junk. You should also join the Dickscord Chat and follow us on [Twatter](#).
